  "deployment_scenario": "The deployment scenario likely involved a developer or team that was following tutorials without fully understanding the use cases. They deployed a massive EKS cluster with 50 nodes for a single microservice, which is an extreme over-provisioning. They also ran CloudFront for internal-only applications, which is unnecessary. Additionally, they used SageMaker notebooks with large instances for trivial workloads and ran RDS databases 24/7 for development environments. These choices indicate a lack of cost awareness and optimization.",
