  "deployment_scenario": "The deployment scenario likely involves a team that has taken a 'Brain damage' approach to cloud architecture. They have deployed a Kubernetes cluster using EKS with over-provisioned m5.2xlarge instances, running Fargate Spot for a simple cron job, using AWS Outposts for a cloud-native application, running AWS Batch for minimal workloads, using AWS Transfer Family when S3 would suffice, and running AWS Elemental MediaLive for static content. This setup is indicative of a team that has misunderstood the requirements and is using the most expensive and complex services available for basic tasks.",

  "roast": "You've taken 'Brain damage' to a whole new level. Over-provisioning instances, using Fargate Spot for a cron job, deploying Outposts for a cloud-native app, and running MediaLive for static content? It's like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Your cloud bill is a testament to your lack of understanding of cost-effective cloud architecture. Maybe next time, try to match the complexity of your services to the actual needs of your applications."
